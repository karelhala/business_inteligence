Hi Magdalena,

I met with Bing Wei today and the long driveway is not included with her property (she says the front home owner planted the plants along the left side of the driveway and that their gardener cares for it). I specifically asked about blowing and she said the other home takes care if it.

So, our scope should only be the hardscape immediately around the rear home and the plants around it, as well.

I will prepare a Custom proposal to include hand-pruning and will send to Bing later this week. FYI she also requested a proposal to install an herb area to replace the front lawn and inquired about an irrigation check. In the meantime, she is staying with Essentials service.

She also mentioned that we can cut back the large Plumbago (light blue flowered plant) near the garage (the gardener didn't want to remove the flowers by cutting it back but she said its okay).

LMK if you need more info :)";"* Question came up whether the long driveway leading to the home is included in the service. Zolene will have a meeting with the customer the week of Aug. 17. Call to get this info.

8389;2015-09-25 15:00:00+00;36;;"Hello Singari, Jesus Sr. and Jesus Jr. stopped by this afternoon to investigate the latest irrigation situation. They did see that the water was running and found where the issue is so the good news is that they can easily fix it! What they found is that you have 6 valves in your valve box; 4 of them are new, but 2 of them are old. It is one of the two old ones that is causing the issue. These valves do wear out over time and they are cheaper to replace entirely than take them apart to investigate what went wrong. As long as they would replace one of them, they are recommending to go ahead and replace both to prevent this issue from happening again in the near future. As far as they can tell, this is not anything directly related to the previous irrigation work.

Your irrigation system is set to run Tuesday early morning and Friday early morning, which is why you noticed the excess water today. The system probably turned on early this morning and the one valve that waters the window box and planters never shut off. To stop the water, Jesus turned the system off this afternoon when he stopped by. The rest of your irrigation system will not be impacted as long as they come back to turn it back on in the next two days, which they are available to do. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with the repairs. The cost for each new valve, installed is $75, or both valves for $150.";;t;"";;;1529;02:00:00

Service History
+ Feedback from gardener
  - July 22: Aaron and I have wrapped up for the day at 750 Hillcrest. We met with and got a tour from Lorraine. She asked us to focus down at the street level of the property deadheading flowers and pruning manzanitas.
On the manzanitas she wanted branches making ground contact pruned off to make leaf collection easier. She is also wanting to thin out the Manzanitas to better expose the red bark.
On a future visit she would like the backyard neighbors eucalyptus debris raked up from the area beyond the very end of the driveway.
The right side property line could use some light hedging. D hedge closest to the street just needs to be hedged even with the fence and the neighbor I will take care of the top. The hedge along her house is to be maintained at approximately 7 feet and is just starting to grow out further than she'd like it. Lorraine is ok with an electric hedger being used.
However Lorraine detests blowers and would like little to no blowing to occur on the property. For instance she will do the blowing on the driveway, as it is rarely needed. I did use the electric blower down at street level very gently to reduce leaves amongst the manzanitas.

Lorraine likes to putter around the garden and is mainly looking for help with weeding pruning and leaf collection

8391;2015-09-25 18:35:00+00;1614;;"Hi Janine,

No problem, we will have him come out tomorrow to check on that head.

When I consulted with Jesus regarding the current leak, he explained that he installed 1804 rain bird Sam prs sprinklers heads, which have check valves built in. By installing this head, the leaking should have stopped. The valve might have a small leak and water is passing through causing the sprinklers to leak but the head should not be allowing the water to flow through the sprinkler when the system is off.

If it's determined tomorrow that the head itself is faulty, incorrectly installed, etc., we will absolutely complete the visit complimentary. If it's determined that it's actually a related valve or something that is not related to the actual head itself, we will have to charge for the visit.";Customer reported another leak in the sprinkler we reported, I will send photos.;t;"";;;1529;01:00:00

1. The leaf blower blew a lot of dust and dirt into my detached garage and also left a lot of dirt on the pavement in the patio area. Can you ask the gardeners to be careful on cleaning up the dirt so as to not blow dirt into my living spaces and also to carefully clear the dirt away from walkways?

Also the two shurbs that are in the front of house next to side gate and on the other side fence are growing too tall.

The front phomium and back phomium need to be deadheaded.

The angiozanthos big red need to be deadhead as the flowers have past the season. Also the succulents on near the big red needs to be deadheaded too.

My citrus trees were not fertilized the last time. Can we get them fertilized this time round?

Service History
+ Feedback from gardener
  - July 22: Aaron and I have wrapped up for the day at 750 Hillcrest. We met with and got a tour from Lorraine. She asked us to focus down at the street level of the property deadheading flowers and pruning manzanitas.
On the manzanitas she wanted branches making ground contact pruned off to make leaf collection easier. She is also wanting to thin out the Manzanitas to better expose the red bark.
On a future visit she would like the backyard neighbors eucalyptus debris raked up from the area beyond the very end of the driveway.
The right side property line could use some light hedging. D hedge closest to the street just needs to be hedged even with the fence and the neighbor I will take care of the top. The hedge along her house is to be maintained at approximately 7 feet and is just starting to grow out further than she'd like it. Lorraine is ok with an electric hedger being used.
However Lorraine detests blowers and would like little to no blowing to occur on the property. For instance she will do the blowing on the driveway, as it is rarely needed. I did use the electric blower down at street level very gently to reduce leaves amongst the manzanitas.

Lorraine likes to putter around the garden and is mainly looking for help with weeding pruning and leaf collection

Service History
+ Feedback from gardener
  - July 22: Aaron and I have wrapped up for the day at 750 Hillcrest. We met with and got a tour from Lorraine. She asked us to focus down at the street level of the property deadheading flowers and pruning manzanitas.
On the manzanitas she wanted branches making ground contact pruned off to make leaf collection easier. She is also wanting to thin out the Manzanitas to better expose the red bark.
On a future visit she would like the backyard neighbors eucalyptus debris raked up from the area beyond the very end of the driveway.
The right side property line could use some light hedging. D hedge closest to the street just needs to be hedged even with the fence and the neighbor I will take care of the top. The hedge along her house is to be maintained at approximately 7 feet and is just starting to grow out further than she'd like it. Lorraine is ok with an electric hedger being used.
However Lorraine detests blowers and would like little to no blowing to occur on the property. For instance she will do the blowing on the driveway, as it is rarely needed. I did use the electric blower down at street level very gently to reduce leaves amongst the manzanitas.

Lorraine likes to putter around the garden and is mainly looking for help with weeding pruning and leaf collection

Can you have them also adjust the irrigation for the planters on the patio? They had put in some different heads that allowed for adjustable water dispensation but there seems to be more water leaking from pots across the patio than before. I tried to adjust them down but it's hard to do without turning them off.
